/*
1. Two ways of passing arguments to a method:
	a. call by value
	b. call by reference
2. What is a reference?
	reference is a variable that holds an address
3. When we pass a refernce as argumnet, we are passing the value of reference as opposed to the object itself.
   Value of a refernce variable is an address where the object is stored.
   Parameter then recieves this address and thus stores the same address as referece variable and this points to
   same object as reference variable;
